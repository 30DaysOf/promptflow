By the end of this learning journey you should be able to:
1. Understand core concepts of promptflow
2. Explore core promptflow developer tools
3. Design and build a basic promptflow app
4. Evaluate and deploy your promptflow app
5. Adopt best practices for LLM Ops (end-to-end)
6. Build your intuition & transfer knowledge to your own app ideas.

## Prerequisites

To work with promptflow, and complete exercises in the repo, you will need:
1. A GitHub Account - fork repo and launch GitHub Codespaces
1. Visual Studio Code - with promptflow extension
1. Azure Account - to deploy your promptflow app

## Preview Guide

The repository contains notebooks for each lab, along with a _website/_ folder that contains an [Astro Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/getting-started/) based static site that you can configure for hosting (in your GitHub Pages) or view in local preview (within GitHub Codespaces).Check out the [website/README](website/README.md) for more details on how the website is setup.

To preview the site locally use the following commands:
